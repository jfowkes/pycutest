Contributing to PyCUTEst
------------------------

Contributions to PyCUTEst are most welcome.

Reporting Bugs / Feature Suggestions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you find a bug in PyCUTEst, or have a suggestion about how PyCUTEst can be improved, please
`create a Github issue <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue>`_.
It would be helpful if you first check the `existing list of open issues <https://github.com/jfowkes/pycutest/issues>`_
to see if someone else has reported the same thing - in this case it would be better to comment on the existing issue
rather than creating a new one.

When reporting a bug, it would be helpful if you could include:

* An informative title and clear description
* A code snippet showing how the error occurred
* Any relevant Python output messages
* Information about your installation (e.g. operating system, Python version/distribution, PyCUTEst version)

Submitting code changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are happy to accept code contributions from the PyCUTEst community.
If you have made a change (bugfix, new feature, documentation improvement, etc), then please
`submit a pull request <https://github.com/jfowkes/pycutest/pulls>`_.
Github has `more information on pull requests <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests>`_.
Please ensure that:

* Your description clearly explains your changes
* You have updated the documentation in :code:`docs`.
  We use `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ to create our documentation.
  You will need to install both the Sphinx and sphinx-rtd-theme packages.
* You have included relevant unit tests in :code:`pycutest/tests`.
  We use `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to run our unit tests
  but we do also provide a :code:`tox.ini` for local testing using `tox <https://tox.wiki/en/latest/>`_.

If you are fixing an issue, please reference the issue number in the pull request.
