Contributing to PyCUTEst
------------------------

Contributions to PyCUTEst are most welcome.

Reporting Bugs / Feature Suggestions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you find a bug in PyCUTEst, or have a suggestion about how PyCUTEst can be improved, please
`create a GitHub issue <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue>`_.
It would be helpful if you could first check the `existing list of open issues <https://github.com/jfowkes/pycutest/issues>`_
to see if someone else has reported the same thing - in this case it would be better to comment on the existing issue
rather than creating a new one.

Submitting code changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are happy to accept code contributions from the PyCUTEst community.
If you have made a change (bugfix, new feature, documentation improvement, etc), then please
`submit a pull request <https://github.com/jfowkes/pycutest/pulls>`_.
GitHub has `more information on pull requests <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests>`_.

Code of Conduct
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We expect everyone in the PyCUTEst community to show respect to each other and behave appropriately at all times.
Abusive language, harassment and inappropriate/unprofessional language is not acceptable.
Instances of unacceptable behavior can be reported to the PyCUTEst team
(`Jari <mailto:jaroslav.fowkes@stfc.ac.uk>`_ and `Lindon <mailto:lindon.roberts@sydney.edu.au>`_).
