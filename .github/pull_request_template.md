**Describe the change(s)**
A clear and concise description of the change(s). If you are fixing an issue, please reference the issue number.

**Have you updated the documentation?**
We use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to create our documentation which is located in the `docs` subdirectory. You will need to install both the `sphinx` and `sphinx-rtd-theme` packages.

**Have you included relevant unit tests?**
We use [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to run our unit tests which are located in `pycutest/tests`. We also provide a `tox.ini` for local testing using [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/).
