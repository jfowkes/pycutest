Contributions to PyCUTEst are always welcome - thanks for your interest in getting this far!

### Reporting Bugs / Feature Suggestions

If you find a bug in PyCUTEst, or have a suggestion about how PyCUTEst can be improved, please
[create a Github issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
It would be helpful if you first check the [existing list of open issues](https://github.com/jfowkes/pycutest/issues)
to see if someone else has reported the same thing - in this case it would be better to comment on the existing issue
rather than creating a new one.

### Submitting code changes

We are happy to accept code contributions from the PyCUTEst community.
If you have made a change (bugfix, new feature, documentation improvement, etc), then please
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/jfowkes/pycutest/pulls).
Github has [more information on pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).

### Code of Conduct
